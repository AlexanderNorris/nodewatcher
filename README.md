# Node Watcher ðŸ‘€
Watches the live nodes on the Cardano Blockchain

## Project Goals
Provide an opensource system for any individual to assess the health of the Cardano Ecosystem. In doing so no one individual entity will be able to make claims but rather as a community we can assess the state of the network and conclude the effectiveness of any Cardano Stake Pool.

Requirements:

- Acquire all nodes to be monitored
- System for monitoring the health of a node
- Determine a set of metrics that can be measured by a third party of a Cardano Stake Pool
- GUI for easy presentation of collected metrics
- Alerting system
- Deployment system Docker-Compose and helm chart for k8s deployments

Limitations:
- Private nodes are out of scope and it will be up to the community to determine the effectiveness of a pool based on nodes that are not publicly registered
